Handeling node b
The node isn't handeled yet
Adding node c to the stack

Handeling node c
The node isn't handeled yet

Handeling node c
This node has already been handeled
Deleting it from the stack
and adding it to the nodes order
(if there is no this node yet)
Now nodes order is [c]

Handeling node b
This node has already been handeled
Deleting it from the stack
and adding it to the nodes order
(if there is no this node yet)
Now nodes order is [c, b]
